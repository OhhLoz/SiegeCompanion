## Acknowledgments

* Had alot of help from the developers of [R6DB](https://www.r6db.com), it was originally going to be built ontop of their API. However due to the GDPR they had to close down their API, after I had written the API Handler code. They had wrote a [guide](https://github.com/r6db/r6db/wiki/Ubi-Api) on how to use Ubisoft's internal API like they do for their website.
